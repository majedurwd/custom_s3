# Custom S3 Node.js Server (TypeScript)

This is a simple Node.js server setup using **TypeScript** and Express that responds with "Hello World".

## Setup

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /pro/study/test_projects/custom_s3
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   (Dependencies include Express and TypeScript toolchain.)
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Run the compiled server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

For development with automatic recompilation:
```bash
npm run dev
```

TypeScript source lives in `src/` and compiled output goes to `dist/`. Feel free to add routes, middleware, or convert to more advanced setups.
